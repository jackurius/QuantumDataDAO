# Submission Draft (Replace with name)

## Documentation

Add documentation for your dataset here. This README file is what will be available to subnets when looking for datasets and to community members when voting for dataset inclusion into the DAO.

Upload your raw data into the features folder in it's original format. If possible, organise it into different files, with the file paths to certain features being denoted in the metadata file. The metadata file should be similar to a .csv file or something queryable, returning the file path based on certain features being requested. How the data is labelled and organised should be made clear in the documentation section of your submission. The features folder and metadata file with NOT be shared with community and subnets. 

Guidelines to submissions can be found in the [main](https://github.com/jackurius/QuantumDataDAO/tree/main) branch. Once your submission is ready, make a pull request to merge into the main branch.
